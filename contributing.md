## How to contribute in AsyncLine

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:
  - [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) make sure you know about thrift RPC
  - [Frugal](https://github.com/Workiva/frugal) want to create/pull new service line? this will help you

## Testing
Make sure your code is really clear, fix and ready too used by testing it by your self.

## Subitting changes
Please send a [Github pull request to AsyncLine](https://github.com/dyseo/AsyncLine/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "this is a new pull from blabla
>
> to fixing some bug at blabla"
```
